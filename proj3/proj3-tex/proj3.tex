This paper describes our group's findings when implementing a feedforward multi layer
perceptron neural network with back propagation, and running the model on various sets of data. 
 More specifically, we show how our model performs on a set of breast cancer data, on data pertaining
to different kinds of glass, on data related to different kinds of soybeans, predicting the age of abalone,
performance values for various computer hardware, and on forest fire data.
	The performance of our model on each respective set of data
 is evaluated in the context of both classification and regression. For datasets where
 classification was performed, performance was evaluated in terms of
 0/1 loss and average cross entropy. For datasets where regression was performed,
 mean squared error and mean absolute error were the chosen metrics to evaluate
 our model. We provided hypotheses for each specific dataset in terms of their overall performance in our model.
 Namely, we hypothesized the specific performance intervals and rough convergence times for each dataset, and our
 hypotheses were generally upheld. For classification and regression data, we chose a specific performance value for
our hypotheses, and decided to uphold our hypotheses if they fell within 5\% in either direction of the hypothesized
value. In terms of convergence time, we specified a number of iterations predicted iterations and again confirmed our hypothesis
if the convergence time found experimentally was within 10\% of the predicted value.

\section{Problem Statement}
Utilizing six datasets- each from unique and differing settings, we implemented a feedforward neural network as an attempt to provide insights 
into the performance of this kind of neural network with respect to differing kinds of data. The model worked on these varying data sets with the aim
of conducting supervised learning, that is- accurately guessing the class corresponding to each entry in the data given other examples of each respective
class the model is attempting to guess. More rigorously, we utilized a multilayer perceptron 
to carry out learning on regression and categorization data. In particular, three of the datasets are used to perform regression 
(Abalone, Computer Hardware, and Forest Fires),
  and three are used to perform classification (Glass, Soybean, Breast Cancer). Each of the six datasets we use in the project have a variable 
  number of classes and either discrete or real valued attributes. As the data sets are each representative of pretty drastically different situations,
  we generated completely seperate hypotheses for each kind of data with regards to its performance in our model. 
  
  For the abalone data, we hypothesized that
  mean squared error and mean absolute error would reflect a high degree of efficacy in predicting the age of abalone. Explicitly, we presumed that mean squared 
  error would be roughly a value of 20, and mean absolute
  error would be roughly a value of 2. The rationale behind these values being that the data provided with each entry in the dataset would seem to be highly correlative
  with the age of abalone (things like the size, weight, and rings on each creature). We thought that our model would be able to generally predict age successfully within
  2 years, which is generally reflected in these hypothesized error values.
  
  For the computer hardware data, we thought that, as with the abalone data, we would expect attribute values to be highly correlative to the classes of hardware.
  Namely, we presumed that mean absolute error would be roughly a value of 80- as each individual class generally spanned a range of about 100 PRP, with a few 
  smaller outliers. This would seem to imply then a mean squared error of roughly 6400.

  For the forest fire data, we thought that predicting classes would be a bit trickier, since here we are attempting to predict the burned area of the forest.
  Just from briefly examining the data, it seems that the area burned can range anywhere from 0 to roughly 1000 hectares. However, most area values are relatively low,
  most are under 50. A high performing model in this scenario would likely produce a mean absolute error around 10. We had relatively low expectations for our model on
  this particular dataset, as the attribute data doesn't seem to be particularly revealing for class values. We predict a mean absolute error around 30 and a mean squared
  error around 1000, but are more or less shooting from the hip with this hypothesis. 

  Moving on to the classification data, we presumed that our model would perform reasonably well comparatively on the glass data set, which had 7 total classes. Guessing
  randomly would provide a roughly 14\% rate of accuracy, so we decided that any accuracy percentage above 90\% would mean a high performance for this data. Thus, we 
  hypothesized a 0/1 loss value of roughly $20$, and a cross entropy value smaller than $0.1$. 

  In terms of the small soybean data, the feature values would seem to be highly related to each of the soybean classes, and the data set only featured four classes,
  meaning that randomly guessing should have a 25\% success rate. As such, we hypothesized a roughly 95\% accuracy rating, implying a 0/1 loss value of roughly
  5. We hypothesized also a cross entropy value $0.001$ on average.

  Lastly, for the breast cancer data, we expected to find that our model also performed quite well. In terms of specific values, the breast cancer categorized
  only two classes (malignant and benign cancer), so random guessing would provide correct answers in theory 50\% of the time. Meaning that a high performing model
  we'd expect to be accurate certainly over 95\% of the time, and we presumed it would be correct 98\% of the time. Implying a 0/1 loss value of roughly 2. In terms of
  entropy, this was harder for us to predict. Since there were only two classes, a higher amount of entropy may be expected than in other data sets, so we predicted
  an average cross entropy value of roughly 1.

  That is, neither data set would perform better than the other on at least 90\% of runs. Performance in this context was measurable by
  0/1 loss and logarithmic loss, with lower values in each corresponding to better performance of the model. For the regression data, we wanted to
  test the same hypothesis, which led us to believe that our best performing data would be the Abalone data set with 4,177 entries, and the Forest
  Fire data set with 518 points would perform worse than the Abalone data, but better than the Machine data with only 209 entries on 90\% of runs.
  Lastly, the Machine data would be the worst performer out of the regression data by our hypothesis, with and without reducing the size of the data.
  Performance in the context of regression was measurable by mean percent error and mean square error, both of which imply better performance with
  lower values.

  We also provide a hypothesis with respect to the amount of time each data set would take to converge in our model. Though not a perfect way to measure
  convergence time, we choose to simply time each run of our model on each differing dataset, and record these times. We hypothesized that the number of
  different feature variables in a data set would correlate strongly with the runtime of the model, since our multi layer perceptron is much more 
  combinatorially expensive as more feature values are introduced. Thus, we predicted that our glass data would run fairly slowly, as we thought the total of
  10 attribute values would cause weights to converge rather slowly, implied by our hypothesized value of roughly 5 seconds per run.
  We predicted too that the machine data, with its 10 attributes, would also converge rather slowly, similarly falling around 5 seconds per run. The
  soybean data, with the most attributes (35), we thought would take the longest to converge, falling at roughly 10 seconds per run. The forest fire data,
  with 13 attributes, we hypothesized would run in roughly 6 seconds. The breast cancer data, with only 8 feature values, we expected to run in only 3 seconds.
  Similarly, the abalone data we hypothesized would run also in roughly 3 seconds, with its 8 attributes. As a general rule of thumb, we expected the number of
  attributes to correlate with how long it would take the weights to converge in each dataset, as the number of attributes are what is feeding into the network
  to contribute to weights in the first place.

  For every single one of our hypotheses, we decided to overturn our findings if their value was not within 10\% of the original hypothesized error value. 
  That is, 5\% in either the positive or negative direction of what we predicted.

\section{Methods}
In order to test our hypotheses, we ran our model using classification on the Glass, Breast Cancer, and Small Soybean data sets, and 
we ran our model using regression on the Abalone, Forest Fire, and Machine data. In order to successfully interpret the data, all feature values
which were not originally real valued were converted to real number values. The only data set with missing attribute values was the Breast cancer
data set, which included `?' values in place of missing data. We simply coerced all missing data to `NaN' values, effectively eliminating them from
being considered in our model. All that this meant was that these particular feature values didn't end up being used in the model. We acknowledge that our
solution in this case reveals potential vulnerabilities in our model, but we justify our choice to exclude this data by the large number of entries in the breast
cancer data set, along with the presence of a wealth of attributes to delineate only two classes. After all of the datasets had been preprocessed, we implemented the multi
layer perceptron, which on a high level takes the form of the following graph:

Where inputs are denoted $I_1$ through $I_n$, a bias node is denoted $B$, the hidden nodes are denoted $H_1$ through $H_{n+1}$, and 
the output node is denoted $O$. Importantly, each edge between nodes corresponds to a specific weight. These weights aren't included on
the diagram for the sake of space, but they are critical for the functioning of the network. TODO!!!! include how weights computed !!!!
Letting $H_j$ designate each of the weights coming from the hidden nodes into the output, and $w_{k,j}$ denote the weights coming from
each of the input nodes, all of the $H_j$ are computed as follows:

\begin{equation}
	H_j = \sum_{k = 1}^{n} I_k*w_{k,j} + b_n
\end{equation}

After the model makes its guesses, we determine model performance using 4 different loss functions.
These loss functions provide an effective method of determining model performance when certain features of the model are changed. Explicitly, letting
$N$ be the number of samples, $k$ be the number of classes, $t_{i,j}$ being the value $1$ if sample $i$ is in class $j$ and $0$ otherwise, and $p_{i,j}$ being the
predicted probability that sample $i$ is in class $j$, the average cross
entropy was computed as follows:
\begin{equation}
	cross entropy = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{k}t_{i,j}ln(p_{i,j})
\end{equation}

The second loss function we introduced was the 0/1 loss function, which is the ratio of incorrect guesses to total guesses made on the testing data.
Denoting the test set $T$, and letting the number of correct guesses made on the test set by the model be denoted $g_c$, the 0/1 loss is computed with the simple ratio:
\begin{equation}
	1 - \frac{g_c}{|T|}
\end{equation}

We chose both of the above loss functions with the motivation that both are metrics with importantly opposed qualities in the evaluation of a multi layer perceptron neural net. 
Perhaps the most immediately logical evaluation of loss is 0/1 loss, 
which is a measurement of the ratio of incorrect guesses made in a test set. Importantly, this is indicative of the accuracy of our model, but is not particularly informative of overfitting.
Cross entropy however is helpful when evaluating the performance of a model while also keeping in mind the potential of overfitting. By incorporating punishments for a choice being more 
`surprising' in that the chances of a correct choice are relatively small, cross entropy is useful in capturing the performance of a model with greater depth than simply counting the number of correct solutions- 
which in turn provides a weariness for overfitting.
Both metrics are important to have an effective model, so both loss functions were chosen in the evaluation of our model on various data.

For regression data, we evaluated the performance of our model using mean percent error and mean squared error. Mean squared error is computed by
simply finding the mean of the squares of the errors. Mathematically, letting $Y$ be the vector of $n$ observed values and $\hat{Y}$ be the vector of $n$ predicted
values, mean squared error $MSE$ is computed as:
\begin{equation}
MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \hat{Y_i})^2
\end{equation}
Similarly, mean percent error $MPE$ is computed by finding the average percentage errors by which the forecasts of a model differ from the ground truth. Letting $a_t$ be the 
ground truth value of a prediction, $f_t$ be the actual value of the prediction, and $n$ being the number of different times a forecast is made, this is rigorously
computed as follows:
\begin{equation}
MPE = \frac{100}{n} \sum_{t=1}{n} \frac{a_t - f_t}{a_t}
\end{equation}
